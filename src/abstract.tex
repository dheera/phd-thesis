Many recent experiments have explored the use of nonclassical states
of light to perform imaging and sensing. Although these experiments
require quantum descriptions of light to explain, the advantages they
claim are not necessarily unique to quantum light. This thesis
explores the underlying principles behind these imaging techniques and
realize classical experiments which demonstrate similar properties to
their quantum counterparts.

The principal contributions of this thesis in quantum-mimetic imaging
are the experimental implementation of phase-conjugate optical
coherence tomography and phase-sensitive ghost imaging, two
experiments whose quantum counterparts utilize phase-sensitive light.
This thesis also explores the use of compressed sensing to further
speed up acquisition of ghost imaging.

Finally, a new paradigm inspired by compressed sensing is
demonstrated, in which high-quality depth and reflectivity images are
simultaneously captured using only the first photon arrival at each
pixel. This paradigm is also extended to the case of single-photon APD
arrays which may offer few-photon low-light imaging capabilities
beyond what is possible with current camera technologies.
